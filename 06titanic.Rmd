## Titanic Data

### Question 1: What characteristics describe those that survived the sinking of the Titanic?

```{r}
# load libraries
library(tidyverse)

# set working directory

# read in the data
z_train <- unz('titanic.zip', filename = 'train.csv')
pre_train <- read.table(z_train, header=T, sep=',')

validate_sample <- as.numeric(sample(row.names(pre_train), 100))
train <- pre_train[-validate_sample,]
validate <- pre_train[validate_sample,]

z_test <- unz('titanic.zip', filename = 'test.csv')
test <- read.table(z_test, header=T, sep=',')

```


### Question 2: Can you predict how likely it would be for you to survive?
